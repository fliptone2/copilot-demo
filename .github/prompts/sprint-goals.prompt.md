Create sprint goals that:

- Are clear, concise, and actionable
- Align with the overall product vision and current priorities
- Focus on outcomes and value delivered to users or stakeholders
- Are achievable within the sprint timeframe
- Are measurable and testable (can be validated at sprint review)
- Reflect collaboration across disciplines (engineering, design, QA, etc.)
- Address any critical risks, dependencies, or blockers

## Format

- **Sprint Goal:** One sentence describing the main outcome or value to be delivered
- **Supporting Objectives:** 2â€“5 bullet points detailing key deliverables, features, or improvements
- **Success Criteria:** How the team will know the goal is met (measurable outcomes, demo scenarios, acceptance criteria)
- **Dependencies/Risks:** List any major dependencies, risks, or blockers that could impact the goal
- **Notes:** Any additional context, priorities, or clarifications

## Example Output

### Sprint Goal

- Write automated tests for authentication scenarios

### Success Criteria
- Users can sign in with valid credentials and are redirected to the homepage
- Invalid login attempts show clear error messages
- All authentication tests pass in CI
- Demo includes sign-in flow for at least two user roles

### Dependencies/Risks
- Awaiting final design for login page
- Integration with domain list API may require additional time

### Notes
- Prioritize accessibility and mobile responsiveness
