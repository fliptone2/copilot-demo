Query Jira and retrieve the user stories for the selected sprint. If I did not specify a sprint, stop and ask for clarification. Only review stories that have are tagged with the "Business" label. Review the stories you find and use them to define the goals for the sprint. The goals  should be structured, clear, and follow the provided template. Use the guidelines and template below to create the markdown for the sprint goals.

# Guidelines
1. The objectives should be conceptual and not simply a list of tasks. Do not reference specific user stories.
2. The objectives should be organized into logical groups that the team can work on collectively.
3. The objectives should be framed in a way that emphasizes the value delivered to users.
4. The objectives should be achievable within the sprint timeframe.
5. The objectives should be measurable and testable (can be validated in the sprint demo).
6. The objectives should reflect collaboration across disciplines (engineering, design, QA, etc.)
8. The objectives should be based on the plan outlined in the project roadmap.
9. Create the overview in a separate Markdown file in the sprints folder.
