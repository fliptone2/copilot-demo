2. Provide a list of the epics that need to be created based on the selected file. 
3. Once the epics are identified, create a structured Markdown file for each epic using the provided template. 
4. Create each epic in a separate Markdown file that lives in its own folder. 
5. Name the folder and the file after the epic title. 
6. Using the provided template to create epics that:
