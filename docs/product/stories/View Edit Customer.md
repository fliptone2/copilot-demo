## Jira Story: [Link to Jira story]

### User Story

**AS A** bank employee  
**I WANT TO** view and edit the customer information associated with a deposit entry  
**SO THAT** I can ensure customer records are accurate and up-to-date for compliance and customer support

### Acceptance Criteria

### Dependencies

- Manage Deposit Entry story
- Integration with customer database or API
- User authentication and authorization

### Open Questions

- Which customer fields are editable from the deposit entry context?
- Should edits to customer data here update the master customer record or only the deposit entry's snapshot?
- Is there a need to restrict edits based on customer or deposit status?
- How is the audit trail for customer changes maintained and accessed?
