## Jira Story: [Link to Jira story]

### User Story

**AS AN** external developer  
**I WANT TO** test deposit integration in a sandbox environment  
**SO THAT** I can validate my app before going live

### Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** sandbox credentials and test data  
**WHEN** I submit deposits and poll status in the sandbox  
**THEN** the system simulates real deposit scenarios and returns expected responses

### Dependencies

- Sandbox/test environment
- Test data and credentials
- API endpoints

### Open Questions

- What scenarios are available in the sandbox?
- How is test data managed and reset?
